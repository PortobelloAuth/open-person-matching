# Portobello Auth Preview Liscense

This documentation, specifications, and code contained in this repository are a
work in progress and may only be previewed for purposes of providing feedback to
Portobello Auth. While it is intended to be released under more liberal terms in
the future it is not now so released. It is currently not deemed fit for any
purpose whatsoever. Organizations wishing to work with Portobello Auth on this
specification are encouraged to contact Portobello Auth to arrange terms.

Automated agents such as Large Language Models or other similar tools may not
incorporate this work or any portion or derivative thereof in either their
training data or any output they create without first obtaining specific
evidence of permission to do so from the copyright holder. Because enforcement
of copyright is acknowledged to be inherently difficult and because automated
tools enable rapid, high fidelity replication that is inconsistent with patterns
of human derivation and learning, failure to comply with this provision
represents a presumptive agreement by both the agent's operator and the agent's
user to fund the development of this project according to terms set unilaterally
by the copyright holder. This provision is expected to be removed in future
liscensing terms.
