# Reference Implementations

This folder contains various reference implementations for portions of the Open
Person Matching specification. Eventually it should contain at least one
Requestor, Facilitator, and Responder implementation, as well as implementations
of important algorithms like the `us-101-key` and `us-reduced-v0` normalization
algorithms and named hashing algorithms.

The experiments subfolder exists specifically for ideas that are not yet fully
specified or implemented, but may be used in the specification or reference
implementations in the future.
