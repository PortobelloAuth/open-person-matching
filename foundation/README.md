# The Portobello Private Identity Foundation

At Portobello, we recognize that identity is the foundation of all fundamental
human liberty and therefore self-sovereign digital identity is foundational
infrastructure for the Internet. We further recognize that, in order to be
trustworthy, security software must be built on open, auditable, equitable, and
evolving standards. Further, the software itself must be auditable to ensure
that it meets those standards and function as a common good. Therefore we intend
to establish the Portobello Private Identity Foundation to act as stewards of
the Open Person Matching specification and reference implementation, the Digital
Authorization Document specification and reference implementation, and other
related self-sovereign digital identitiy specifications and implementations -
each to be released under open source liscenses.

As foundational digital technologies self-sovereign identity, authentication,
authorization, and privacy benefit all of us broadly and must not be controlled
by any one entity. Current identity solutions rely on approved issuers:
generally governments and service providers. The identity documents they provide
rely on their customers' trust in their continued security and financial
success. These documents are neither portable nor verifiable between issuers,
resulting in myriad unique accounts, one or more per service, that do not truly
belong to the person being identified and impose significant redundant costs on
service providers and the individuals that they serve. The Portobello Private
Identity Foundation, loosely modeled after the Mozilla Foundation, the Let's
Encrypt Foundation, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is intended to
provide a mechanism to fund and sustain the continued development, adoption, and
application of portable, private, and independant self-sovereign digital
identity.

## Funding

Portobello Health and Portobello Auth are names used by Madsen & Madsen, LLC.
under which we have designed and developed the Open Person Matching
specification and related technologies. Our primary business interest is in
enabling secure, private, and authorized managment of personal health records
and other private digital documents. It is neither financially sustainable nor
technologically appropriate for us to unilaterally fund these efforts. We
welcome proposals for the structure and funding of The Portobello Private
Identity Foundation.

### An Endowment?

One method to ensure the continued operation of The Portobello Private Identity
Foundation is to establish an endowment with sufficient donated funds to allow
the foundation to operate off of the returns from investing the endowment. Such
an endowment would grant the foundation a degree of independence from the
influence of financial pressures and large funding organizations.
